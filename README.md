# Hand Tracking and Draggable Rectangles with OpenCV and CVZone

This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and `cvzone`, with draggable rectangles on the screen that can be controlled through hand gestures. The application captures video from a webcam, detects hand movements, and updates rectangle positions based on the cursor's location.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Detects and tracks hand gestures using the `cvzone` library.
- **Draggable Rectangles:** Allows user to move rectangles on the screen by interacting with them through hand gestures.
- **Dynamic Rectangle Updates:** Adjusts rectangle positions dynamically based on detected hand movements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- `cvzone` library

To install the required libraries, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
